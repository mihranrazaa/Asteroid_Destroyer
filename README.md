# Asteroid Destroyer?

---

## Introduction

A game where you control a spaceship and destroy asteroids. This is my first ever game. It is using pygame and pygame_GUI, the game gets over when you collide with an asteroid. 

## Controls 

W -- Move forward

A -- Rotate left

D -- Rotate right

S -- Move backward

Space -- Shoot

## How to Play

Just download the Compiled version of the game from the releases page or download the source code from Github.

## BTS

- The triangle is also a circle in the game logic, so it can be easier for me to implement collision detection as a newbie.
- I dunno what to write here..
- I can't decide what name i should give to the game, so i gave the BEST GENERIC NAME ::::: ASTEROID DESTROYER!!!
