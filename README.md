## Introduction

A game where you control a spaceship and destroy asteroids. This is my first ever game. It is using pygame and pygame_GUI, the game gets over when you collide with an asteroid.

S -- (Move Forward)Rotate backward

Space -- Shoot

---

## How to Play

Just download the Compiled version of the game from the releases page or download the source code from Github.

## BTS

- The triangle is also a circle in the game logic, so it can be easier for me to implement collision detection as a newbie.
- I dunno what to write here..
- I can't decide what name i should give to the game, so i gave the BEST GENERIC NAME ::::: ASTEROID DESTROYER!!!

## Versions

- v1.0: Initial release
- v1.1: Improved Controls, (Personally i feel comfortable using the new controls), Better movement
- v1.2: Added End Screen :: You can leave the game by pressing the escape key or spacebar. :: Added Score counter, 5 per asteroid destroyed.
