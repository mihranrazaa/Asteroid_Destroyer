# Asteroid Destroyer?

---

## Introduction

A game where you control a spaceship and destroy asteroids. This is my first ever game. It is using pygame and pygame_GUI, the game gets over when you collide with an asteroid. 

## Controls 

W -- Move forward

A -- (Move Forward)Rotate left

D -- (Move Forward)Rotate right

S -- (Move Forward)Rotate backward

Space -- Shoot

Endscreen -- Press Space to Restart OR Esc to Quit

## How to Play

Just download the Compiled version of the game from the releases page or download the source code from Github.

## BTS

- The triangle is also a circle in the game logic, so it can be easier for me to implement collision detection as a newbie.
- I dunno what to write here..
- I can't decide what name i should give to the game, so i gave the BEST GENERIC NAME ::::: ASTEROID DESTROYER!!!
- In the building run i added more random features, i first thought of only adding Score counter, which is a good thing to have, but then i also saw that with pygame i can add BGM(Background Music) very easily so i added it. Then i thought why not make it more challenging? so i added a timer that decreases the speed of the asteroids as the score increases. 
- I forgot to mention after score counter i added the Game over screen, which i really really wanted to add, as it felt like a good way to end the game.
